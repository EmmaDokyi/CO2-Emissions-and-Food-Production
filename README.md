# 🌍 Global Food Production and CO₂ Emissions Analysis: Efficiency and Undernourishment Trends (2001–2019)

**Project Date:** May 2025  
**Tools Used:** Power BI, Power Query, DAX

---

## 🗂️ PROJECT BACKGROUND

This project explores the relationship between global food production and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from 2001 to 2019. Using Power BI, data from 12 key food crops across multiple countries and continents were cleaned, transformed, and analyzed. The goal was to identify sustainability trends, regional disparities, and potential climate-smart agricultural models.

## 📝 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Global food production and CO₂ emissions have both increased significantly over the past two decades. While food availability has expanded and undernourishment rates declined globally, this progress often came at the cost of rising emissions. The analysis uncovered top producers, most efficient countries, and major contributors to CO₂ emissions per capita — revealing opportunities for emission-efficient, equitable food systems.

## 🎯 Metrics


- 📈 **Metrics Created with DAX**:
  - **Total Food Production** – Total quantity produced of the 12 selected food crops per country
  - **Total CO₂ Emissions** – Annual CO₂ emissions per country and continent
  - **Efficiency Score (Food per ton of CO₂)** – Total food production / total CO₂ emissions
  - **CO₂ Emissions per Capita** – Total CO₂ emissions ÷ population
  - **Undernourishment Rate** – Percentage of the population experiencing chronic hunger

## 📊 KEY INSIGHTS

### 🌐 **Global Trends (2001–2019)**
- **China**: Largest CO₂ emitter  
- **Brazil**: Top food producer  
- **DR Congo**: Most emission-efficient country  
- **Trinidad & Tobago**: Highest CO₂ emissions per capita  
- **Global undernourishment** dropped from **16.13% to 11.52%**

## ✅ CONCLUSIONS

### Food production has grown globally — but not always equitably or sustainably
While total food output increased, countries like DR Congo saw efficiency decline and undernourishment rise during the same period, showing that production alone doesn’t guarantee food security or improved livelihoods.

### High CO₂ emissions don’t always correlate with high food output
For instance, South Africa is the number one CO₂ emitter in Africa but not the top food producer. This highlights inefficiencies and raises questions about emission-heavy practices with limited food return.

### Countries like Nigeria and Myanmar represent scalable models for climate-smart agriculture
Nigeria led in food production with relatively low emissions per capita, while Myanmar showed strong efficiency. These cases demonstrate the potential for low-emission, high-output agriculture strategies.

### CO₂ emissions and food production have risen in tandem — except in Europe and North America
In Europe and parts of North America, food production continued while emissions either declined or stabilized, hinting at successful decoupling through technology, policy, or operational efficiency.

### Undernourishment has decreased globally, but regional disparities remain
Africa’s undernourishment fell from ~25% to ~20%, while Asia made stronger progress. However, South America saw a reversal after initial gains — signaling that economic or political instability can undo sustainability gains.

### High per capita emitters often contribute little to global food supply
Countries like Trinidad & Tobago and Saudi Arabia top the per capita CO₂ list but are not major food producers, suggesting a need for emission accountability in non-agricultural sectors as well.

Overall, the findings support the urgency of investing in emission-efficient, equitable food systems that reduce hunger while minimizing environmental impact. This data-driven framework can guide sustainable agriculture strategies and climate-resilient development.

## 💼 OUTCOME

This project helped visualize the trade-offs between agricultural growth and carbon emissions, offering a framework to identify **climate-smart agricultural models**. It provides a valuable tool for sustainability advocates, policy analysts, and agribusiness stakeholders seeking to promote food security without increasing environmental costs.
