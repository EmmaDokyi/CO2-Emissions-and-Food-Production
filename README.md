# 🌍 Global Food Production and CO₂ Emissions Analysis (2001–2019)

**Project Date:** May 2025  
**Tools Used:** Power BI, Power Query, DAX

---

## 🗂️ Project Background

This project explores the relationship between global food production and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from 2001 to 2019. Using Power BI, data from 12 key food crops across multiple countries and continents were cleaned, transformed, and analyzed. The goal was to identify sustainability trends, regional disparities, and potential climate-smart agricultural models.

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

Global food production and CO₂ emissions have both increased significantly over the past two decades. While food availability has expanded and undernourishment rates declined globally, this progress often came at the cost of rising emissions. The analysis uncovered top producers, most efficient countries, and major contributors to CO₂ emissions per capita — revealing opportunities for emission-efficient, equitable food systems.

## 🛠️ Tools & Metrics

- 🔧 **Data Preparation**: Power Query for cleaning and transformation  
- 📈 **Metrics Created with DAX**:
  - **Total Food Production** – Quantity of 12 selected food crops per country
  - **Total CO₂ Emissions** – Annual emissions data per country and continent
  - **Efficiency Score** – Food produced per ton of CO₂ emitted
  - **CO₂ Emissions per Capita** – Total CO₂ divided by population
  - **Undernourishment Rate** – Share of population facing chronic hunger
